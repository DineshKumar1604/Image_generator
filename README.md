This project is a desktop application built in Python that uses OpenAI's DALLÂ·E API to generate images from text prompts. It features a modern and user-friendly GUI built with CustomTkinter, allowing users to enter a prompt, select an artistic style, specify the number of images to generate, and view the generated images in a slideshow format.
